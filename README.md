# Git-Game-17I260A

Projects ideo is to learn git usage by making simple text based game. Everyone is free to add new features to the game but not delete. Ofcourse fixing is allowed. It is prefered to keep the game within reason, so basicly no perverted shit. 

Github is not only about code, if you are not in the mood to write code you can improve the projects documentation. For example you can create tutorials for others who want to learn but dont know for example how to use classes. Guides are appreciated.
